# ReMeLife-Project
ReMeLife is the world's first crypto rewards-based person-centric AI optimised health and social care community. As a pioneering social impact business, ReMeLife leverages the power of crypto and decentralized communities to democratize and share the value inherent in digital care work. Our ecosystem enables members to care for their family and clients while building a 'care to earn' derived passive income.

Comprised of multiple b2c and b2b apps that through its core app RemindMecare, ReMeLife generates a proprietary Electronic Life Records database. Key apps hosted on Playstore include RAPP, ReMeLife and ReMeLife, RemindMecare and RAPP
Ongoing projects includes an in progress proof of stake blockchain build, AI LLM agentic modelling pending build, NFTs and other ecosystem models, such as DeFi.

ReMeLife is developing an AI LLM (Large Language Model) agentic project to enhance the care process through advanced AI solutions. The project is building AI agents to refine and improve care strategies, leverage AI to provide personalized and engaging care experiences and optimise the use of its proprietary data process and data sets, including Electronic Life Records (ELR). OUtput includes actionable insights for better care management and a passive activity based income.
